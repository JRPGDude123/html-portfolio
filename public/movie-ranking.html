<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Midnight in Paris</h3>
<h4><p>Starring Owen Wilson. This movie is about an author who is on vacation with his fiance in Paris. He goes for a walk one night and ends up getting picked up by a cab that takes him to the past.</p></h4>

<h3>Bullet Train</h3>
<h4><p>Starring Brad Pitt. This movie is jam-packed with action, taking place on a Japanese speed train. It feels like a movie that Quentin Tarentino himself directed.</p></h4>

<h3>Catch Me If You Can</h3>
<h4><p>A lovely film starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks, in a classic game of cat and mouse.</p></h4>
